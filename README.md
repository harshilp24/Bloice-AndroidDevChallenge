Tell us what your idea is.



Bloice -  A assistance for blind people. My Idea is to make an app for blind people, where app is called via speech from Google assistant like "OK Google, open bloice", when the app is opened, we can perform task with the help of users voice. User can hold camera against any book, newspaper, place, object or anything. We will then convert the image/text/object into speech and let the user know what was the text or object. User can also ask for color, like "what color the car is ?".


Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life.


I was working on this project and I saw #AndroidDevChallenge is live which gave me hope and confidence to speed up the work. We really hope to solve the problem and hope to make this product widely accessible.Sample code is written in Java and currently we are in experimenting phase, trying out different things to make sure the best method is used for the purpose.
Google cloud’s vision API is very accurate to do such work.I have added a few code files which I have used till now. It is developed by using MLkit and Google translate. 
 
How Google could help us achieve the goal :
-Provide a Mentor for the project
-By advising ways to optimise the ML model
-Help us get a BETA audience
-Free credits/trail for Google APIs until it's released 
-Data set for the project
